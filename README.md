🌊 Toxic Waters: Marine Pollution & PhytoplanktonAn analysis of how microplastics and human activity impact the "lungs of our oceans."📌 Project OverviewPhytoplankton are the invisible heroes of our planet—they produce over 50% of the world's oxygen and regulate global temperatures.1 However, they face a growing threat: Microplastics.This project investigates the intersection of:Marine Biodiversity: How plastic density correlates with phytoplankton decline.Human Behavior: Analyzing whether global fishing vessels avoid or ignore high-pollution "hotspots."📊 Data SourcesThe study integrates three massive global datasets to build a comprehensive picture of ocean health.DatasetPeriodSourceKey MetricsMicroplastics1972–2022NCEIPlastic Density, CoordinatesPlankton1958–2017PANGAEAChlorophyll-a, Sea Surface Temp (SST)Fishing Vessels2012–2020Global Fishing WatchFishing Hours, Vessel Location🛠️ MethodologyOur analytical pipeline was built using Python to handle over 56 million rows of data:Data Refinement: Scrubbed metadata, handled null values, and standardized spatial coordinates (Lat/Long) for seamless merging.Temporal Segmentation: Divided data into three eras (1973-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2022) to track changes over decades.Spatial Analysis: Used Geopandas to map fishing density against known plastic accumulation zones.Correlation Modeling: Analyzed chlorophyll-a levels as a primary proxy for phytoplankton health.💡 Key Findings📉 The Decline is Real: We observed a consistent downward trend in phytoplankton populations globally.2🧪 Plastic Correlation: While a link exists between plastic density and plankton loss, it is not yet statistically significant in our current model, suggesting other stressors (like warming) are also at play.🚢 Fishing Resilience: Surprisingly, human fishing effort shows zero decrease in heavily polluted areas. Economic activity continues unabated despite environmental degradation.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:pandasnumpymatplotlibgeopandasInstallationClone the repositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/[your-username]/marine-pollution-plankton.git
